        <h2>Get to know me a bit, will you?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a mechanical engineer born in Brazil, based elsewhere. 
          In 2023, I started learning more about web development and software engineering, and that is where I found my passion.
          Though I am a late bloomer, my goal now is to make this my full-time carreer. 

          In my free time, I love playing volleyball and trying as many new restaurants as I can possibly find. 
          I am also a language enthusiast. I taught English as a second language for over 10 years, before teaching myself Spanish. 
          Now, I have been studying German for a few months, so that I can finally communicate properly with my Austrian in-laws.
